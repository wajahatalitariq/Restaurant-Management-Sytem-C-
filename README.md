# Restaurant/Hotel Management System

This C++ project provides a basic management system for restaurants or hotels, enabling users to view menus, place orders for tables or rooms, and track active orders. Admins can add menu items, view orders, and manage resources. The system is built using data structures like structs and vectors, offering a foundation for further development. Future improvements could include order modification, error handling, and enhanced user interaction.
